# MO-PASS
Appointment scheduling (AS) is one of the key factors used to improve patient satisfaction in healthcare services. A practical and robust appointment scheduling solution allows clinics to utilize medical assets, equipment, and resources in an efficient manner. This study introduces a Multi-Objective Patient Appointment Scheduling System (MO-PASS) to enhance clinic operations and patientsâ€™ satisfaction. This framework takes advantage of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) to optimize objectives simultaneously without negatively affecting others. To address stochastic parameters and the uncertain nature of the AS problem, this algorithm is used in a simulation-optimization setting to create a simheuristic model. The efficiency of the proposed framework is tested in a breast cancer clinic system with multiple physicians and patient types. Finally, the MO-PASS performance is compared against three heuristic approaches and its results were promising.
